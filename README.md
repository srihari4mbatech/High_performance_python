This are practice exercise of book titled "High Performance Python"

Tuples are immutable and lists are mutable, that is lists are resizeable; howerver tuples are not.
Tuples are cached by the Python runtime that means we don't need to 
reserve memory every time we want to use one. Lists and tuples take mixed types.
* Instantiating a list is 5.1x times slower compared to instantiating tuple.
* unordered lists and tuples search complexity is o(n) compared to dictionary/set complexity of o(1).
